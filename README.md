As of its publication in June 2022, the ARAD 1K natural spectral image data set is the largest collection of natural hyperspectral images published to date.

This repository will serve to provide access to the data set, facilitate evaluation of follow up work, as well as host support code for the data set.

This data set contains 950 publicly images and 50 “test” images which have only been released as RGB or Multi-Spectral-Filter-Array “RAW” files.

Publicly available images have been published as:
* 31 channel hyperspectral images in the 400-700nm range
* 16 channel multi-spectral images in the 400-1000nm range
